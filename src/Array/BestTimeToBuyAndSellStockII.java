/**
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
 * You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
 * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
 *
 * Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
 *              Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
 *
 * find the valley first, then find the peak. Calculate the peak.
 * [1,   4,   7,   5,   9]
 * [买，卖/买, 卖,  买,   卖]
